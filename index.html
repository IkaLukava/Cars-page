                <p>*Vehicle incentives and rebates are programs made available by car manufacturers 
                   to encourage vehicle sales by providing consumers with cash allowances or favorable
                   financing/lease rates. Incentives can vary by location,
                   vehicle configuration, as well as the buyer's method of payment 
                   (cash purchase, financing, lease).Some incentives can be stacked 
                   with other incentive programs, and some have eligibility conditions that 
                   must be met to qualify. Additional incentives are sometimes targeted to 
                   customer segment groups like college graduates, military members, etc.
                   Incentives are normally subject to change and governed by specific eligibility rules. Please 
                   see your local dealer for details on incentives that might be available to you.
